# scripts Repository Guide

Welcome to the `scripts` repository. This guide will help you set up and run the provided scripts.

## **Cloning the Repository**

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/programming101dev/scripts.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd scripts
```

Ensure the scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

## **Prerequisites**

To ensure you have all of the required tools installed, run:
```bash
./check-env.sh
```

If you are missing tools follow these [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPqlPD1mie5iwJ2XAcNGz7WeA86dTLerFXs9sAuwCco/edit?usp=drive_link).

To determine which compilers you have installed on your system, run:
```bash
./check-compilers.sh
```

## **Running the setup.sh Script**

To setup the system the first time, run:

```bash
./setup.sh -c <c compiler> -x <c++ compiler>
```

To the see the list of possible compilers:
```bash
cat supported_c_compilers.txt
cat supported_cxx_compilers.txt
```

## **Running the update.sh Script**

After the system has been setup you will want to periodically update from github and rebuild:

```bash
./update.sh -c <c compiler> -x <c++ compiler>
```

## **Running the update-all.sh Script**

If you want to verify that everything compiles with all of the supported compilers, run:

```bash
./update-all.sh
```

## **Testing the shared CMakeLists.txt**

Before committing changes to `CMakeLists.txt`, run:

```bash
./test-cmake.sh
```

It configures and builds a matrix of tiny sample projects (library+executable
with a shared source, relative headers, whitespace/zero target lists, missing
config, code that must be rejected by clang-tidy, and a C++ variant) against
the `CMakeLists.txt` in this directory, so regressions are caught here instead
of in a student's build. Use `-k` to keep the sandbox with all logs.

## **Running the acceptance checks**

To verify that copied templates are self-contained aside from intentional
shared-artifact symlinks such as `.flags`, run:

```bash
./check-templates-standalone.sh
```

It copies `template-c`, `template-c-program`, and `template-cxx` to `/tmp`,
rejects hidden parent-workspace script dependencies, and configures, builds,
and tests each copied project.

To run the broader p101 stack ratchet, use:

```bash
./check-p101-stack.sh -c clang -x clang++
```

That script builds repos from `repos.txt`, runs the standalone template check,
and then runs the `p101-tool-playground` tour. During development, you can use
`--skip-repo-build` for a quicker smoke of the template and playground pieces.

## **Discovering new flags**

To see every flag your installed compilers support that `flags/*.txt` has no
decision on yet, run:

```bash
./harvest-flags.py gcc clang
```

It queries the installed binaries themselves (`gcc --help=<section>`,
`clang --autocomplete=...`) — no network, no compiler sources needed, works
with Apple clang — and writes two files per compiler under `flag_report/`:
`<cc>-canonical.txt`, the full flag universe marked `[+]` included / `[-]`
excluded / `[?]` undecided, and `<cc>-new-flags.txt`, just the undecided
flags bucketed by which `flags/` file they belong in. An active line in
`flags/*.txt` means *include*; a commented line means *considered and
rejected* — to make a decision, move the flag into the right file in one of
those two forms, bump `version.txt`, and `generate-flags.sh` will probe
whether each choice actually works on each machine. Run it again after a
compiler upgrade to see what new checks became available.

## **Discovering common non-POSIX Unix functions**

To seed future `lib_unix` wrappers, use:

```bash
./fetch-unix-doc-sources.sh -d /tmp/unix-doc-sources
./discover-common-unix-functions.py \
  --linux /tmp/unix-doc-sources/linux-man-pages \
  --freebsd /tmp/unix-doc-sources/freebsd-src \
  --macos /tmp/unix-doc-sources/apple-Libc \
  --posix-symbols /path/to/posix-symbols.txt \
  --posix-html /path/to/posix/functions/toc.html \
  --output /tmp/unix-doc-sources/common-unix-functions.csv \
  --emit-probes /tmp/unix-doc-sources/probe-work
```

The analyzer computes:

```text
documented(Linux) ∩ documented(FreeBSD) ∩ documented(macOS)
  - POSIX interfaces
  - existing p101 wrappers
  - built-in legacy/unsafe exclusions
```

The CSV is only a wrapper backlog. Treat the generated compile probes as the
real gate: copy `/tmp/unix-doc-sources/probe-work` to macOS, FreeBSD, and
Linux machines and run:

```bash
cd /tmp/unix-doc-sources/probe-work
CC=cc ./run-probes.sh
```

Only functions that compile and link on all target systems should be promoted
to `lib_unix` candidates. Documentation finds the goblins; compiler probes
decide which goblins are real functions.

`--posix-symbols` accepts a simple newline list. `--posix-html` accepts a local
POSIX function TOC or individual function page; if sibling function pages are
present locally, the analyzer reads their `NAME` blocks too. That matters
because POSIX groups related interfaces on one page, so an index-only list can
miss names such as formatted I/O variants.

By default, the analyzer also excludes old or unsafe interfaces such as
`mktemp`, old BSD signal-mask APIs, obsolete byte/string aliases, `getw`/`putw`,
`getpass`, and historical globals. Use `--include-all` to see them in the CSV as
`excluded-legacy`, or `--no-default-excludes` if you intentionally want the raw
set.
